CSE 6242 Team 44 Final Project: Dynamic Chess Valuation with Deep Neural Networks

DESCRIPTION
This folder contains the deliverables for the Team 44 project, which include code for neural network model training and interactive visualization, and the poster and final report.

INSTALLATION
This code uses Python 3.7.  To install the packages required for the visualization, complete the following steps:
1) Navigate to CODE/Visualization
2) Run pip install -r requirements.txt

EXECUTION
To execute the visualization, complete the following steps:
1) Navigate to CODE/Visualization
2) Run python app.py to serve the visualization to localhost:5001.  If another port is desired, provide the port number as an argument, like python app.py 6001
3) In a web browser, navigate to localhost:5001.  Initialize the board with the buttom 'Start Position.'  Then, play both sides of a chess game and see how the chess piece values change.
